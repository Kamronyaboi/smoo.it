This branch is used so that maintainers can deploy changes to the server configuration of `api2.smoo.it`.

Simply edit the `docker-compose.yml` and it should be deployed automatically.

If you need to make changes to the software itself, commit and push them to the `api` branch first.

Adding or editing subdomains to `smoo.it` is not possible for maintainers of this repo.
